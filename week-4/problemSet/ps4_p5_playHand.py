def playHand(hand, wordList, n):
    """
    Allows the user to play the given hand, as follows:

    * The hand is displayed.
    * The user may input a word or a single period (the string ".")
      to indicate they're done playing
    * Invalid words are rejected, and a message is displayed asking
      the user to choose another word until they enter a valid word or "."
    * When a valid word is entered, it uses up letters from the hand.
    * After every valid word: the score for that word is displayed,
      the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the user
      is asked to input another word.
    * The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.
    * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters or the user
      inputs a "."

      hand: dictionary (string -> int)
      wordList: list of lowercase strings
      n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)

    """
    # Keep track of the total score

    # As long as there are still letters left in the hand:

        # Display the hand

        # Ask user for input

        # If the input is a single period:

            # End the game (break out of the loop)


        # Otherwise (the input is not a single period):

            # If the word is not valid:

                # Reject invalid word (print a message followed by a blank line)

            # Otherwise (the word is valid):

                # Tell the user how many points the word earned, and the updated total score, in one line followed by a blank line

                # Update the hand


    # Game is over (user entered a '.' or ran out of letters), so tell user the total score
